# Hexbrush

This project is a Turing front-end evelopment project focused on working with React, Postgres, Express and Knex. It is deployed to Heroku [here](https://hexbrush-fe.herokuapp.com/).

This app is for users who would like design inspiration for their color palettes. It allows users to create projects and assign different color palettes to those projects. Colors can be locked and regenerated until the user is happy, or edited later if they desire a change.

## UI Design

The spec we were given had no information on UI design elements, so we started by wireframing a general idea of our layout.

Then we created a high-fidelity prototype of the design on Figma to have a more detailed idea of where we wanted everything to go on the different web pages.
